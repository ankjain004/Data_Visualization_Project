# Udacity : Data Visualization Project

# Project Overview

Objective of this project to apply Data analysis skills along with data visaulization and prepare/publish analysis into dashboard or story format. 
US Census Demographic Data is being used for Data analysis and visualization to showcase various findings and pictorical presentation.

# Source of DataSet

Downloded data from Udacity material.

# Area of Analysis.

**1. Transportation System**

Certainly this is very subjective questions and need to assess lots of factors to conclude but in Dataset, we have following columns related with transportation so we will use them to make some analysis.

Drive   : Percent commuting alone in a car, van, or truck
Carpool : Percent carpooling in a car, van, or truck
Transit(Public Transport) : Percent commuting on public transportation
Walk : Percent walking to work
OtherTransp : Percent commuting via other means

There is another column "MeanCommute Mean commute time (minutes)", but there is no direct relationship of its value with other columns.

In general, Self-drive, carpool, walk or other transports are not mode of transport to say State/County has best transport system, rather its Public transport (Transit) which is less-expensive, frequent, ensure connecitivity & reachability, eco-friendly, flexible ticketing options.

Here we will analyze data to see which states has good Transit system, which counties of states contributed more into transit system, what is % usage of other modes of transport on those states/county. 
We will also see modes of transport usage by people in high populated and less populated states. 

## Tableau Public Reference

With the help of Tableau, we have prepared Data Visualization Story along with Filter with States. So user can select any state or set of states to see % of transport mode.

**2. Population density & Diversity.**

In US cencus data, we have data about population in each states/counties along with total number of Men & Women. We also have % population of various community like Asian, black, hispanice, Native, White, pacific. 
Some analysis around this data can be useful for various purposes like :

1. Launching new business targetting to specific community. 
2. Organize festive events on States/Counties based on % population.
3. Evacuation operations by Home country. 
4. Migrants preferred State/County by specific region of people. 

There could be many more business case of such data analysis.
