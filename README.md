# Data_Visualization_Project
## US Census Demographic Data is being used for Data analysis and visualization to showcase findings around Transportation system.
1 . Which states have the best transportation?

Certainly this is very subjective questions and need to assess lots of factors to conclude but in Dataset, we have following columns related with transportation so we will use them to make some analysis.

Drive   : Percent commuting alone in a car, van, or truck
Carpool : Percent carpooling in a car, van, or truck
Transit(Public Transport) : Percent commuting on public transportation
Walk : Percent walking to work
OtherTransp : Percent commuting via other means

There is another column "MeanCommute Mean commute time (minutes)", but there is no direct relationship of its value with other columns.

In general, Self-drive, carpool, walk or other transports are not mode of transport to say State/County has best transport system, rather its Public transport (Transit) which is less-expensive, frequent, ensure connecitivity & reachability, eco-friendly, flexible ticketing options.

Here we will analyze data to see which states has good Transit system, which counties of states contributed more into transit system, what is % usage of other modes of transport on those states/county. 
We will also see modes of transport usage by people in high populated and less populated states. 

With the help of Tableau, we have prepared Data Visualization Story along with Filter with States. So user can select any state or set of states to see % of transport mode.
